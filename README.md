# NeuronNetworkProject
#Timothy Hoang.

I used google colab for this project due to big amount of libraries downloads.
NOTE:
Please add the csv file onto the google colab path before run.
The expected Margin of errors expected is printed on a table in the project file.
each variable with the "_DN" at the end of their name are the variables to look at. They are the one trained with the deep neural network. the other ones are linear model.
- female_model_DN -> single input
- regression_model_DN -> using multiple inputs from train set (70%)
- test_regression_model_DN -> using multiple inputs from test set (15%)
- validation_regression_model_DN -> using multiple inputs from validation set (15%)


epochs = 250.


I did not clearly understand what i had to turn in so I display the errors occurred during training as a Margin table.
